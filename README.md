# Short Term Real Estate Rental Market Analysis

***This project analyzes short-term rental market trends for **Company XYZ** using publicly available datasets sourced from **Kaggle** in the real estate rental scene in Bali. The objective is to examine guest demand, host acceptance behavior, and supply-demand gaps to optimize listing strategies and improve booking conversions.***

---

By leveraging **data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling**, this project uncovers insights into **guest search behavior, pricing preferences, and host response patterns**. Key areas of analysis include **acceptance rates across different countries, booking trends based on property attributes, and the impact of pricing filters on reservation success**.

The findings provide actionable recommendations to **increase host participation, refine pricing models, and bridge supply-demand mismatches** in the short-term rental industry. Through **visualization and statistical evaluation**, this project helps **Company XYZ** gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics and improve overall booking efficiency.

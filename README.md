# Short Term Real Estate Rental Market Analysis

***This project analyzes short-term rental trends by examining guest demand, host acceptance rates, and supply-demand gaps. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling to extract actionable insights.***  

---

## Project Aim  
This project explores **guest search behavior, host responses, and booking trends** to identify patterns that influence rental market dynamics. The goal is to **optimize listings, improve acceptance rates, and bridge supply-demand gaps** in short-term rentals.  

---

## Technical Skills Demonstrated  
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handling **missing values**, filtering anomalies, and structuring datasets for analysis.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating **new variables** to enhance insights, such as guest preferences and booking trends.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing market trends, acceptance rates, and search behavior.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying **pricing, demand, and host response patterns**.  
- **Acceptance Rate Modeling**: Examining **host acceptance trends** across different regions and guest criteria.

## Business Scenario  
Short-term rental platforms track **guest searches and host responses** to optimize bookings. This project addresses the following:  

- **What are the most common guest search trends?**  
- **Which factors influence host acceptance rates?**  
- **What gaps exist between guest demand and host supply?**  
- **How can listings be optimized to improve market efficiency?**

## Methodology & Technical Skills Demonstrated  

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- **Filtered missing data** and structured datasets.  
- **Standardized date formats** for trend analysis.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Visualized demand and acceptance trends** using Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
- **Examined pricing, duration, and guest preferences.**  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- **Extracted key insights** from guest searches and host responses.  
- **Created derived features** to analyze supply-demand mismatches.**  

### 4. Statistical Modeling  
- **Analyzed acceptance rates** across different countries.  
- **Identified pricing strategies** that impact booking conversions.**

## Key Findings & Conclusion  
- **Guest search trends show a preference for entire homes/apartments and private rooms.**  
- **Acceptance rates vary significantly by country, with some markets underperforming.**  
- **Data-driven optimizations can improve host engagement and maximize bookings.**
